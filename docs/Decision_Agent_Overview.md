# Decision Agent for Zoho CRM

**Empowering Teams to Make Better Decisions, Together**

---

## What is Decision Agent?

Decision Agent is a smart integration that bridges your team's conversations in Slack with your business data in Zoho CRM. It transforms informal team discussions into structured, trackable decisions—automatically recorded in your CRM for future reference.

In today's fast-paced business environment, important decisions often get lost in chat threads, buried in email chains, or forgotten entirely. Decision Agent solves this problem by providing a simple, democratic way for teams to propose, vote on, and finalize decisions—all within Slack, with every outcome automatically synced to Zoho CRM.

## The Problem We Solve

Every organization faces these challenges:

- **Lost Decisions**: Important team decisions made in meetings or chat conversations are never documented
- **Lack of Accountability**: No clear record of who proposed what, who agreed, and when it was decided
- **Scattered Information**: Decision history lives in people's memories, not in your business systems
- **Inefficient Processes**: Getting team consensus requires lengthy email threads or scheduling meetings
- **No Audit Trail**: When questions arise later, there's no way to trace back to the original decision

## How Decision Agent Works

Decision Agent introduces a simple yet powerful workflow that fits naturally into how your team already communicates:

### Step 1: Propose

Any team member can propose a decision directly in a Slack channel. Simply describe what needs to be decided, and Decision Agent creates a formal proposal for the team to consider.

### Step 2: Vote

Team members cast their votes—approve or reject—right within Slack. No need to switch applications, schedule meetings, or send emails. Voting is quick, transparent, and accessible to everyone in the channel.

### Step 3: Decide

Once the required approval threshold is reached, Decision Agent automatically finalizes the outcome. The decision is marked as approved or rejected based on the team's collective vote.

### Step 4: Sync

Every finalized decision is automatically recorded in your Zoho CRM. This creates a permanent, searchable record of all team decisions—complete with who proposed it, how people voted, and when it was decided.

### Product Development

A product team uses Decision Agent to vote on feature priorities. When the team decides to prioritize a new feature, the decision is automatically recorded in Zoho CRM, linked to the relevant project for future reference.

### Budget Approvals

A department needs to approve discretionary spending. Team leads propose expenditures, team members vote, and approved budgets are recorded in the CRM with full voting history.

### Policy Changes

HR proposes a new remote work policy. Employees vote on the proposal, and once approved, the decision and its outcome become part of the organization's permanent record.

### Project Go/No-Go Decisions

Before launching a new initiative, stakeholders vote on whether to proceed. The decision, along with all supporting votes, is captured in Zoho CRM for project documentation.
